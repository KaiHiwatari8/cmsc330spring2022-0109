Welcome to CMSC330 Spring 2022, section 0109! Here I will try my best to curate notes and work from all of our discussion sessions, extra notes for exams, quizzes, and projects, reference links, free tools, etc. Feel free to clone or fork it, contribute to it, or raise issues in it.

**Unofficial Office Hours:** Use it to discuss concepts, projects, quizzes, exam **WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY** (restrictions including but not limited to: do not give away solutions, do not discuss quizzes/exams before everyone has taken it, etc), and more importantly socialize. I am also in the group, which means if you need any help, just tag me :).
